.Sh NAME
.Nm lldpd
.Nd LLDP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dvxcseik
.Op Fl X Ar socket
.Op Fl m Ar management
.Op Fl M Ar class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon able to receive and send
.Em LLDP
frames. The Link Layer Discovery Protocol is a vendor-neutral Layer 2
protocol that allows a network device to advertise its identity and
capabilities on the local network.
.Pp
.Nm
also implements an SNMP subagent using AgentX protocol to interface to
a regular SNMP agent like Net-SNMP. To enable this subagent, you need
something like that in your
.Xr snmpd.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
master agentx
.Ed
.Pp
This daemon implements both reception and sending. It will collect
various information to send LLDP frames to all Ethernet interfaces,
including management address, speed and VLAN names.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
This option can be specified many times to increase verbosity.
.It Fl v
Listen on VLAN as well. This option might be needed if your equipment
send frames on VLAN instead of physical interface. This option enables
.Nm
to receive frames on VLAN interfaces as well. If you don't need this
option, do not set it.
.It Fl k
Disable advertising of kernel release, version and machine. Kernel name
(ie: Linux) will still be shared, and Inventory software version will be set
to 'Unknown'.
.It Fl x
Enable SNMP subagent.
With this option,
.Nm
will enable an SNMP subagent using AgentX protocol. This allows to get
information about local system and remote systems through SNMP.
.It Fl X Ar socket
Enable SNMP subagent using the specified socket.
.Nm
will enable an SNMP subagent using AgentX protocol for the given
socket. This option implies the previous one. The default socket is
usally
.Em /var/agentx/master .
You can specify a socket like
.Em tcp:127.0.0.1:705
for example. Since the process that will open this socket is enclosed
in a chroot, you need to specify an IP address (not a hostname) when
using a TCP or UDP socket.
.It Fl c
Enable the support of CDP protocol to deal with Cisco routers that do
not speak LLDP.
.It Fl f
Enable the support of FDP protocol to deal with Foundry routers that do
not speak LLDP.
.It Fl s
Enable the support of SONMP protocol to deal with Nortel routers and
switches that do not speak LLDP.
.It Fl e
Enable the support of EDP protocol to deal with Extreme routers and
switches that do not speak LLDP.
.It Fl m Ar management
Specify the management address of this system.
.Nm
only sends one management address. It will use the first one that it
finds or the one that you specify with this option. This option can
use wildcards.
.It Fl M Ar class
Enable emission of LLDP-MED frame. The class should be one of the
following value:
.Bl -tag -width "0:XX" -compact
.It Sy 1
Generic Endpoint (Class I)
.It Sy 2
Media Endpoint (Class II)
.It Sy 3
Communication Device Endpoints (Class III)
.It Sy 4
Network Connectivity Device
.El
.It Fl i
Disable LLDP-MED inventory TLV transmission.
.Nm
will still receive (and publish using SNMP if enabled) those LLDP-MED
TLV but will not send them. Use this option if you don't want to
transmit sensible information like serial numbers.
