.Sh NAME
.Nm lldpd
.Nd LLDP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dvxcse
.Op Fl m Ar management
.Op Fl p Ar probe time
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon able to receive and send
.Em LLDP
frames. The Link Layer Discovery Protocol is a vendor-neutral Layer 2
protocol that allows a network device to advertise its identity and
capabilities on the local network.
.Pp
.Nm
also implements an SNMP subagent using AgentX protocol to interface to
a regular SNMP agent like Net-SNMP. To enable this subagent, you need
something like that in your
.Xr snmpd.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
master agentx
.Ed
.Pp
This daemon implements both reception and sending. It will collect
various information to send LLDP frames to all Ethernet interfaces,
including management address, speed and VLAN names.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
This option can be specified many times to increase verbosity.
.It Fl v
Listen on VLAN as well. This option might be needed if your equipment
send frames on VLAN instead of physical interface. This option enables
.Nm
to receive frames on VLAN interfaces as well. If you don't need this
option, do not set it.
.It Fl x
Enable SNMP subagent
With this option,
.Nm
will enable an SNMP subagent using AgentX protocol. This allows to get
information about local system and remote systems through SNMP.
.It Fl c
Enable the support of CDP protocol to deal with Cisco routers that do
not speak LLDP.
.It Fl s
Enable the support of SONMP protocol to deal with Nortel routers and
switches that do not speak LLDP.
.It Fl e
Enable the support of EDP protocol to deal with Extreme routers and
switches that do not speak LLDP.
.It Fl m Ar management
Specify the management address of this system.
.Nm
only sends one management address. It will use the first one that it
finds or the one that you specify with this option. This option can
use wildcards.
.It Fl p Ar probe time
Specify the time to wait (in seconds) before accepting a given
protocol. This time will be used by
.Nm
to detect false positives like SONMP frames running through a switch
only supporting CDP. This value is only used when multiple protocols
are enabled.
