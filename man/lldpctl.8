.Nd control LLDP daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl L Ar location
.Op Fl P Ar policy
.Op Ar interface ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program controls
.Xr lldpd 8
daemon.
.Pp
When no specific option is given,
.Nm
displays the list of discovered neighbors along with
some of their advertised capabilities. If some interfaces are given,
only those interfaces will be displayed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable more debugging information.
.It Fl f Ar format
Choose the output format. Currently
.Em plain
and
.Em xml
formats are available. The default is
.Em plain.
.It Fl L Ar location
Enable the transmission of LLDP-MED location TLV for the given
interfaces. This option can be repeated several times to enable the
transmission of the location in several formats. Several formats are
accepted:
.Bl -tag -width "XX"
.It Em Coordinate based location
The format of
.Ar location
is
.Ar 1:48.85667:N:2.2014:E:117.47:m:1
The first digit is always
.Ar 1 .
It is followed by the latitude, a letter for the direction (
.Ar E
or
.Ar W
for East or West), the longitude and a letter for the direction (
.Ar N
or
.Ar S
). The next figure is the altitude. It can be expressed in meters (the
next letter is then
.Ar m
) or in floors (the letter should be
.Ar f
). The last digit is the datum. It can either be
.Ar 1
(WGS84),
.Ar 2
(NAD83) or
.Ar 3
(NAD83/MLLW).
.It Em Civic address
The location can be expressed as an address. The format of the
location is then
.Ar 2:FR:6:Commercial Rd:3:Roseville:19:4
The first digit is always
.Ar 2 .
The next two letters are the country code. Then, arguments are paired
to form the address. The first member of the pair is a digit
indicating the type of the second member. Here is the list of
valid types:
.Bl -tag -width "XXXX." -compact

.El
.It ECS ELIN
This is a numerical string using for setting up emergency call. The
format of the location is then the following:
.Ar 3:0000000911
where the first digit should be
.Ar 3
and the second argument is the ELIN number.
.El
.Pp
When setting a location for a given port, all previous locations are
erased. To erase all location, just use the empty string. There is
currently no way to get the location from the command line.
.Pp
.It Fl P Ar policy
Enable the transmission of LLDP-MED Network Policy TLVs for the given
interfaces. This option can be repeated several times to specify
different policies. Format (without spaces!):

.It Ar U
Unknown Policy Flag.
.Bl -tag -width "X." -compact
.It Sy 0
Network policy for the specified application type is defined.
.It Sy 1
Network policy for the specified application type is required by
the device but is currently unknown. This is used by Endpoint
Devices, not by Network Connectivity Devices.
.El
.It Ar T
Tagged Flag.
.Bl -tag -width "X." -compact
.It Sy 0
Untagged VLAN. In this case the VLAN ID and the Layer 2 Priority
are ignored and only the DSCP value has relevance.
.It Sy 1
Tagged VLAN.
.El
.It Ar VLAN-ID
IEEE 802.1q VLAN ID (VID). A value of 1 through 4094 defines a
VLAN ID. A value of 0 means that only the priority level is
significant.
.It Ar L2-Prio
IEEE 802.1d / IEEE 802.1p Layer 2 Priority, also known as Class of Service
(CoS), to be used for the specified application type.

.El
.It Ar DSCP
DiffServ/Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value as defined
in IETF RFC 2474 for the specified application type. Value: 0 (default
per RFC 2475) through 63. Note: The class selector DSCP values are
backwards compatible for devices that only support the old IP
precedence Type of Service (ToS) format. (See the RFCs for what
these values mean.)
.It Examples:
.Bl -tag -width "X." -compact
.It Sy 1:0:1:500:6:46

.It Sy 2:0:1:500:3:24
Voice Signaling (2): not unknown (0), tagged (1), VLAN-ID 500, l2 prio Excellent Effort (3), DSCP 24 (CS3, Class Selector 3)
